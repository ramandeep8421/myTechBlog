      <p class = "serv-text">we provide the ultimate platform to the students as well as professionals for interating with each other in thefield of technology and innovations
      In our platform a user can share the latest advancement in the technology field , his/her interview experiences , personal experiences in tech industry and roadmaps to the people
    who are preparing for cracking the technical interviews at the major tech FANG companies.
   This platform is neccesery because many of these companies facebook , amazon , google , microsoft do not generally visit
 the tier 2 or 3 colleges for placements but there are many offf-campus ways to apply for them and get your dream job there such that the professionals working there at these
companies provides the exact roadmap to crack these technical rounds of these companies.

  So, what should you do?
  The first thing you should do is focus on the fundamentals. This is something that people really tend to skip a lot and it's even more important if you did a bootcamp or you didn't study computer science as an undergrad.

  What does this look like?

  This looks like going through all of those common data structures and algorithms and reviewing them. It looks like going through a linked list and understanding not only what a linked list is and how to implement it, but what are all of those common algorithms that go along with linked list?

  So for example how do I reverse a linked list? How do I insert a node into a linked list? How do I delete a node? How do I swap two nodes? All of these questions are core to that fundamental understanding of what a linked list is. And most people have not gone through this nearly enough.

  There are a lot of pretty tricky questions out there just within this realm of fundamentals.

  For example deleting a node from a binary tree, do you actually know how to do that right now? Because if you don't you probably need to go back and review. These should all be things that you can just pull out of a hat because you already know exactly how to do them. And so if you don't know how to do them that's the place that you need to start. Coding interviews are just a matter of combining all of these different patterns from different places, and those patterns start with the fundamentals. So if you don't know your fundamentals you won't have the patterns to draw on.

  You can’t just go straight to Google interview questions or Facebook interview questions specifically, until you have mastered the basics.CLICK TO TWEET
  The next thing that you should do once you understand those fully, all of those patterns, and all of those different fundamental data structures, is to understand how to solve these problems. The problems that you might see in your interview and learn how to get unstuck when you see them. This is one of the biggest problems that I see people have. It's not that they actually don't know the stuff they need to know to solve the problem. As long as they’ve done their fundamentals they know everything they need to know to solve the problem. But the issue is that they are getting stuck somewhere and don't know how to get unstuck.

  So the next most important thing is to really understand and practice of getting unstuck in a problem when you see it. I wrote a blog post about this if you want to check it out. There are ten different techniques that I use to get unstuck when I'm working on an interview question and I don't know what to do.

  I highly recommend that you check that out, because that's a super important thing to cover. And now only once you've done all of these things and only once you feel really confident on answering interview questions in general, this is when you can start to look at company specific prep. This is when you're just tweaking around the edges where you're basically good and you know everything you need to know, it's just that little bit of refinement that's gonna put you over the edge for your FAANG coding interview. And really give you that leg up when you go to the company.

  The key thing here if you're looking for that information is go to GlassDoor.com. GlassDoor is hands down the best place for this information. What you’ll find at GlassDoor:

  Interview questions that people were asked at the company
  What sort of experiences people had
  What you can expect when you go into the interview
  You only want to do this at the very end when you're trying to refine everything. This is the point where I like to work with people who really have everything nailed down and then we can get into that FAANG company specific stuff and really research and figure out what they need to know for that company.

  If you're worried about preparing for a specific company, focus on overall prep first. Then you can come back to worrying about that company later, once you've got that really nailed down.

                 <p>We also provides the information about the on-compus placement drives goiing on in the ppanjab university campus as well as pool placements drives  going on in other colleges so that most of the students of our college are placed
                   in these MNCs.
                   PUSSGRC has Training, Placement & Industrial Liaison committee, headed by Mr.Rajeev Kumar Dang. As part of this committee, Dr. Balwant Raj is the overall Training Incharge. Committee has faculty members from each branch of Engineering and MCA. This committee looks after all Training & Placement related activities for the benefit of students. For efficient and smooth working of this committee, student committee is constituted which works under the guidance of faculty members. The student members from each department are selected on the basis of personal interviews conducted by faculty members. Besides creating different job avenues for the students, the committee ensures that students are well equipped to meet the requirements of the industry . For enhancing the employability of students, various workshops, seminars and expert talks are organized by this committee. Committee works in close liaison with Central Placement Cell, Panjab University Chandigarh. The students of the campus have been placed in reputed firms like Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Accenture, Quark, SML ISUZU, Mahindra & Mahindra, Ambuja Cement, Honda, Wipro, ITC, Infogain, L&T Infotech, HP. In addition to this, students of our campus are working in various Public sector undertakings, state services & armed forces. Every year students pursue higher studies in India and abroad.
